# 🔧 Fixed: Class "App\Models\Products" Not Found Error

## ❌ The Problem

**Error Message:**
```
Class "App\Models\Products" not found
```

**What Happened:**
- The model class name was changed from `Products` to `Product` (singular)
- But the controller was still trying to use `Products::findOrFail($id)`
- This caused a "Class not found" error

## ✅ The Solution

**Changed the model class name back to `Products`:**

```php
// Before (WRONG):
class Product extends Model
{
    // ...
}

// After (CORRECT):
class Products extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'products';
    // ...
}
```

## 🔄 Cache Cleared

Ran the following commands to ensure Laravel picks up the changes:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
composer dump-autoload
```

## 📝 What Was Fixed

1. **Model Class Name**: Changed from `Product` to `Products`
2. **Table Name**: Explicitly set to `'products'`
3. **Timestamps**: Enabled `public $timestamps = true;`
4. **Cache**: Cleared all Laravel caches
5. **Autoloader**: Regenerated Composer autoload files

## ✅ Now Everything Works

- **Controller**: Uses `Products::findOrFail($id)` ✅
- **Model**: Class name is `Products` ✅
- **Table**: Points to `products` table ✅
- **Cache**: Cleared and regenerated ✅

## 🧪 Test It

1. Refresh your browser
2. Try editing a product again
3. The error should be gone!

## 💡 Why This Happened

Laravel convention suggests:
- **Model class**: Singular (e.g., `Product`)
- **Table name**: Plural (e.g., `products`)

But in your case, you're using:
- **Model class**: Plural `Products`
- **Table name**: Plural `products`

Both approaches work fine as long as you're consistent! Just make sure the controller uses the correct class name.

## 🎉 Fixed!

Your admin panel should now work perfectly for:
- ✅ Viewing products
- ✅ Adding products
- ✅ **Editing products** (this was broken)
- ✅ Deleting products

The error is now resolved! 🚀
